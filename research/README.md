# Poker Research
Before writing the full-on Poker AI for NL Hold'Em Poker, i did some research and implementation for more basic imperfect information games (Rock-Paper-Scissors, Kuhn Poker, Leduc Poker). This gave me the confidence and work my way up to the full scale poker.

I learned CFR through this paper: http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf

Credits to the [Pluribus](https://github.com/zanussbaum/pluribus) repository which was also helpful in helping me understand Monte-Carlo CFR as well as depth-limited solving. The `leduc` folder from the original repo has been copied into `research/leduc`.

Large part of the final algorithm will be built on top of the code from that repository.
